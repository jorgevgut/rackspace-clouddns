# Rackspace CloudDNS API Wrapper

A simple ruby library to communicate with Rackspace Cloud DNS service.

*The service is in beta at this moment.* 

## Installation

Install via rubygems: (**not published yet**):

    gem install rackspace-clouddns

Install via github:

    git clone git@github.com:sosedoff/rackspace-clouddns.git
    cd rackspace-clouddns
    bundle install
    rake install

## Usage

**Create a CloudDns client**

```ruby
dns = CloudDns::Client.new(:username => 'API USERNAME', :api_key => 'API KEY', :location => :uk)

# or via shortcut
dns = CloudDns.new(:username => 'foo', :api_key => 'bar')
```

**Get a list of all existing domains**

```ruby
# Get list of 10 domains
domains = dns.domains

# Get 50 domains with offset
domains = dns.domains(:limit => 50, :offet => 10)

# Search domains by name
domains = dns.domains(:name => 'foo.com')        
```

**Get a list of all domain records**

```ruby
domain = dns.domain(12345)

# returns all records
records = domain.records

# get only specific type of records
# types are: A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, NS, TXT, SRV
records = domain.find_records('A')

# or find records via shortcut
records = domain.mx_records

# find specific record
record = domain.record('A-12345')
```

**Domain manipulation**

```ruby
domain = dns.domain(12345)

domain.name = 'new.foo.com'

# saves domain information
domain.save 

# deletes the domain
domain.delete

# create a new domain
domain = dns.create_domain('foo.com', :email => 'your@email.com')

# returns true if domain is new
domain.new?
```

**Domain records manupulation**

```ruby
domain = dns.domain(12345)

# Add a new record
domain.add_record(:type => 'A', :name => 'foo.com', :data => '127.0.0.1', :ttl => 3600)

# Or add via shortcut:
domain.a(:name => 'foo.com', :data => '127.0.0.1')
domain.cname(:name => 'www.foo.com', :data => 'foo.com')
domain.ns(:name => 'ns.rackspace.com', :data => 'ns.rackspace.com')
domain.mx(:name => 'mail.foo.com', :data => 'mail.google.com', :priority => 10)

# Edit an existing record:

record = domain.a_records.first
record.data = 'NEW_IP_ADDRESS'
record.save     # save this records directly

# Delete the record
record.delete 

# Save domain (all new records will be created and all changed will be updated)
domain.save
```

**Useful record methods**

```ruby
# returns true if this record does not exist
record.new?    

# returns true if record data was changed
record.changed? 

# shortcuts to check if record is a specific one
record.a?
record.aaaa? # ipv6
record.mx?
record.cname?
record.txt?
record.ns?
record.srv?
```
